Download Production DB from yourapp.meteor.com into your local meteor instance
usage:

> download.sh YOURAPP.meteor.com [local meteor directory, defaults to "."]

Tested on OSX, but should theoretically be portable.

Motivation: last time I tried to download the DB, it took me a couple of hours (installing mongo, getting the arguments right, etc).  So I built a time-saving tool
